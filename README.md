## Game Rules

Klondike Solitaire follows a specific set of rules that define how the game is played. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

1. **Setup**: The game starts with a shuffled deck. Cards are dealt into seven tableau piles. The first pile has one card, the second has two, and so on, until the seventh pile has seven cards. Only the top card of each tableau pile is face-up.

2. **Objective**: The goal is to move all cards to the four Foundation piles, sorted by suit from Ace to King.

3. **Moving Cards**: You can move cards between tableau piles or to the Foundation piles. A King can be placed in an empty tableau pile.

4. **Drawing Cards**: Draw cards from the Stock pile. If the Stock is empty, you can turn over the Waste pile to reuse those cards.

5. **Winning the Game**: You win by moving all cards to the Foundation piles.

For a detailed explanation of the rules, you can refer to the official Klondike Solitaire guidelines.
